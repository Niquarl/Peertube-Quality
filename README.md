# Peertube-Quality
Hoping to create a somewhat complete list of all quality stuff on the Peertube federated network. I don't judge the instance where the account is hosted but the video content from that account. In this spirit, I shall give the username and not a link. There is no question that this list is subjective, I try to not the quality of video and audio but also the content of the video too. If you have any suggestions, please open a new issue or if you do not have a github account DM via mastodon.

## Politics
Framasoft (the people behind Peertube) consider free software political. I agree. This list is not meant as to show only groups that I 'endorse' or 'support' (by voting, tooting, organizing) but rather to show that political parties do not have to host video on Youtube (or dailymotion) but can do so on Peertube, wether on friendly instances or their own. *I will however not share links to fascist or others who promote hate and discrimination.*

# About this
This list is compiled by Niquarl (niquarl@mastodon.social). It is a work-in-progress. Please do not consider this the definite list of what's actually worth checking out on Peertube. If for whatever reason you do not want to be publicly listed, just contact me and I will take you off.
