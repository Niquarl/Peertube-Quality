# Peertube-Quality
Hoping to create a somewhat complete list of all quality stuff on the Peertube federated network. I don't judge the instance where the account is hosted but the video content from that account. In this spirit, I shall give the username and not a link. There is no question that this list is subjective, I try to not the quality of video and audio but also the content of the video too. If you have any suggestions, please open a new issue or if you do not have a github account DM via mastodon.

## Politics
Framasoft (the people behind Peertube) consider free software political. I agree. This list is not meant as to show only groups that I 'endorse' or 'support' (by voting, tooting, organizing) but rather to show that political parties do not have to host video on Youtube (or dailymotion) but can do so on Peertube, wether on friendly instances or their own. 

*I will however not share links to fascist or others who promote hate and discrimination.*
